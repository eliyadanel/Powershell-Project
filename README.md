# Powershell-Project
Hi all,
This is my 1st GitHub repository! 
I'm planning on uploading a few basic powershell scripts I've created as part of my studies. 
I would love to hear any suggestions for improvement.
Feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](www.linkedin.com/in/eliya-danel) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/eliya.danel.7).
If you like my scripts make sure you hit that star button on your way out :) 

Some detail about the scripts:

1. Remote_Install.ps1 : made to remotelly install msi files on computers connected to a domain. to be executed on a Domain Controller. 
2. Reverse_Shell.ps1 : made to activate a reverse shell session via net-cat. It downloads net-cat for windows and activiates it. Make sure you have another computer with a net-cat listener before you use it.
